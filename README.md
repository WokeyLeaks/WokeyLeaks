The 'Woke' culture is insidious, and it is expanding.

What started in *2016 as an ideology held by angry idealistic college students in the most liberal parts of North America, 'wokeness' is beginning to pervade everybody's daily lives. The myths need to be exposed.

There are countless issues with woke culture. For example, one of the main problems is that it's not easy to notice. Even when noticed, it can seem harmless and in some cases can even seem funny. So first and foremost, it's necessary to be aware of wokeness, and to be aware that it is far from harmless.

Another issue is that woke culture is thought to be largely contained within colleges, universities and extreme left-wing think tanks. It is not. The culture is spreading into coporations and governments. This crossover is where things get serious.

Lastly, because of woke culture's almost Kafkaesque nature, rejecting wokeness (or even questioning it) can be extremely difficult, and one runs the risk of being 'cancelled'. For the time being, therefore, wokeness needs to be addressed anonymously.

To that end, WokeyLeaks was founded. It is where people can securely and anonymously upload documents/videos exposing woke culture at it's highest levels of influence.

Join us in the battle of ideas.

Peace and Love always,
Zhe/Zher.

*The roots of wokeness can be traced back to post-modernism in Western Europe with Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida in the 1960's and 70's, but the events at Evergreen college (WA, U.S.A) in 2016 are the best current example of woke culture at work.
